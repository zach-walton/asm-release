Overview:

asm_release.c, given an ASM disk name, issues an ASMOP_CLOSE_DISK via the
asmlib ABI.  A great breakdown of the asmlib ABI is located here:

http://www.scaleabilities.co.uk/2013/02/07/diagnosing-asmlib/

Usage:

./asm_release ASMXXXXXX # where ASMXXXXXX is the name of the disk to close

Known Issues:

Though this demonstrably interfaces with the asmlib ABI (the 32-bit
oracleasm_abi_info.ai_status field is updated by the read() call),
the format of oracleasm_close_disk_v2.cd_handle is unclear.  Looking at the
asmlib source suggests that this value should be a 64-bit inode number, but so 
far asm_release returns -EINVAL, which indicates that the hash value passed
via oracleasm_close_disk_v2.cd_handle is not in the right format.

From oracleasm.c:

    disk_inode = ilookup5(asmdisk_mnt->mnt_sb, handle,
                          asmdisk_test, ASMFS_I(inode));
    if (!disk_inode)
                return -EINVAL;

So it's calling ilookup5() from fs/inode.c and passing 
oracleasm_close_disk_v2.cd_handle as (unsigned long) hashval, which should get
a hit in the inode table but doesn't.

It would be ideal to get an strace of an ASMOP_CLOSE_DISK so we can determine
the format of oracleasm_close_disk_v2.cd_handle.
